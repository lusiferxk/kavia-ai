**Step 5** - Preview

At the top of the right panel, you will see two main views: **Code** and **Preview**. In the **Code** view, you can explore all the project files through an integrated code editor. In the **Preview** view, you can see a live visual representation of your website or application as it is being developed. This makes it easy to track changes and understand the progress visually.
