# 5.0 Building Your First App 

## 5.1 Web Based App

Let’s walk through the process of creating a simple website using Kavia. For this example, we'll build a basic **web-based app**.

### Step 1: Start from the Home Screen

1. Navigate to the **Home** section on the left sidebar.
2. At the center of the screen, you’ll see a prompt that asks:
   **“What do you want to build today?”**
3. Below that, you’ll see two options: **Apps** and **Projects**.
   Make sure **Apps** is selected.
4. At the bottom you will be able to select what type of an application that you are going to build. So for this tutorial we need to select **Web** and as for the framework we need to select **React**.

![Home-07-03-2025\_02\_13\_PM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/4f9cc85c-584a-49f8-a663-48a60a50792d#media-blob-url=true\&id=c35f9fd8-e63c-4199-a900-e89196c60afb\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Home-07-03-2025_02_13_PM.png\&size=153917\&width=1903\&height=860\&alt=Home-07-03-2025_02_13_PM.png)

1. If you are building a **mobile app** you need to select **Mobil**e and then **framework**.

![Home-07-04-2025\_11\_48\_AM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/8cfd8b39-4aae-49e5-81c5-078a7f9d29ca#media-blob-url=true\&id=34e3da41-d0b4-4940-be48-afee0b3bfae9\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Home-07-04-2025_11_48_AM.png\&size=140780\&width=1920\&height=869\&alt=Home-07-04-2025_11_48_AM.png)

 

1. If you are building a **backend** for an application you need to select **Backend** and then **framework**.

![Home-07-04-2025\_11\_50\_AM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/8a36ee2b-08a0-4ed7-b296-e9e46ab30424#media-blob-url=true\&id=ee4314e5-01d1-4e57-8666-007c3f9d3cbc\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Home-07-04-2025_11_50_AM.png\&size=145742\&width=1920\&height=869\&alt=Home-07-04-2025_11_50_AM.png)

 

1. If you are building a **full stack application**, You need to select **Full stack** and the relevant **Frameworks** for the project. Please follow this link for the tutorial or scroll down to topic **5.2**.

![Home-07-04-2025\_12\_29\_PM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/580e6aad-12c7-452e-a51a-ac4e45270d4e#media-blob-url=true\&id=33854a63-b667-4316-ab01-d89f98b21d3e\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Home-07-04-2025_12_29_PM.png\&size=192641\&width=1920\&height=1115\&alt=Home-07-04-2025_12_29_PM.png)

 

### Step 2: Enter Your Prompt

In the input box, describe the app you want to create. In this tutorial, I will enter the following prompt and Select Web because i am going to make a web application and select React as the stack and Click the **Arrow Icon** :

> **"Create a modern, responsive personal portfolio website for a freelance architect. The site should include the following sections: Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact. Each section should be accessible via a navigation bar. The Projects section should display 3 sample projects with images, titles, and short descriptions. The Contact section should include a form with fields for Name, Email, Subject, and Message. Style the site with a clean, minimal design using modern fonts and subtle animations. Make it mobile-friendly and accessible."**

Kavia will process your request and begin building the application automatically, complete with frontend and backend code (if required), UI layout, and logic.

![Home-07-03-2025\_02\_16\_PM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/2ab5775a-20d4-4c3a-8782-10981a88dedc#media-blob-url=true\&id=27b461d6-4477-420c-b9fc-71cbd3125df1\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Home-07-03-2025_02_16_PM.png\&size=184655\&width=1903\&height=860\&alt=Home-07-03-2025_02_16_PM.png)

 

### Hint: Prompt Writing Tips for Best Results

To get the most accurate and complete applications from Kavia, follow these best practices when writing prompts:

* **Be clear and specific**: Describe the core functionality, design preferences, and behavior of the app.
* **Include user interactions**: Mention what the user should be able to do (e.g., “User should be able to submit a form and receive a confirmation.”).
* **Mention design or UI requirements**: If you want a particular layout or style, include it in the prompt.
* **State desired technologies (optional)**: If you prefer specific frameworks or stacks (e.g., React, Flask), add them to your prompt.
* **Use complete sentences**: Natural language helps Kavia interpret your intentions better than keyword-only instructions.

 

### Step 3: Confirm Project Overview and Core features.

Once you've submitted your app prompt, Kavia will generate a project overview page containing all the details it extracted from your input. Review each feature carefully—you can add, edit, or delete features as needed. You can also modify your tech stack, apply custom styles, and integrate third-party services like Supabase, Stripe & GitHub. You have to select the relevant GitHub account for the project. Once you're satisfied with all the settings and configurations, click Start Implementation to begin building your app.

#### 1. Review the Project Overview

In the **Project Overview** section, Kavia provides a brief summary of the project, automatically extracted from your initial prompt.

* Carefully review this summary to ensure it aligns with your goals.
* If any information is missing or needs correction, use the **Edit** option to make changes.

After connecting both your GitHub and Supabase accounts, click **Start Implementation** to begin building your application with Kavia.

 

### Step 4: Let Kavia Prepare the Workspace

Once you've clicked “Start Implementation”, Kavia will begin **preparing your Code Generation environment**. This may take a few moments. Once setup is complete, you will see the following interface:

* **Left side**: A **chat panel** where Kavia communicates with you.
* **Right side**: A **VS Code-style editor** where your application code is generated and organized.

![T0015-07-03-2025\_02\_36\_PM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/eea2b0d9-217d-4b74-a479-22c917afcaaf#media-blob-url=true\&id=da903a1d-afae-45ba-93a7-a62c36a6f247\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=T0015-07-03-2025_02_36_PM.png\&size=209514\&width=1903\&height=860\&alt=T0015-07-03-2025_02_36_PM.png)

 

### Step 5: Collaborate with Kavia via Chat

In the chat panel, Kavia will typically begin with a system-generated message. For example:

*Would you like me to write all the code for this website, create a comprehensive plan, build a test suite, perform visual verification, or perhaps answer questions about the architecture? Or do you need help with something else? 🤔*

Once you review the plan, reply:

> **Yes, please start the implementation**

![Projects-06-25-2025\_12\_39\_PM.png](blob\:https://kavia-team.atlassian.net/b57acee1-914d-4a85-bbf3-41cc7f07049a#media-blob-url=true\&id=23d91f80-7650-4f92-8712-9900ad03aca8\&collection=contentId-57344004\&contextId=57344004\&mimeType=image%2Fpng\&name=Projects-06-25-2025_12_39_PM.png\&size=164963\&width=1920\&height=928\&alt=Projects-06-25-2025_12_39_PM.png)

 

Kavia will proceed step-by-step. When it asks if it should move on to the next development stage (e.g., *Step Two* and *Step Three*), respond accordingly:

> **Please proceed to step two**
> **Yes, please proceed** (for the next step)

This step-by-step chat guidance helps you stay in control of the development process while letting Kavia handle the heavy lifting.

### Step 6: Preview

To preview the app you're building, simply click the Preview button located at the top-left corner of the right panel. This will open a live preview of your application so you can see the current state of your build.

 

### Step 7: Enabling the Edit Mode

Enabling Edit Mode allows you to directly select and modify components within the preview, without needing to give instructions through the Kavia chat. This feature helps you fine-tune the design and functionality to match your exact vision. Once you've made changes in the preview using Edit Mode, make sure to save them. After completing all your edits, click the Disable Edit Mode button to continue working on the project.

 

### Step 8: Deployment

Click the + button located next to the Deploy button, then select the container from the dropdown. If you are working on a multi container project it will show them as well. In here we only see the one container and now we need to select it and then configure the settings and click **Create Frontend Deployment**. Kavia will automatically deploy the app for you.

For a Full Stack application Deployment you need to Deploy both front end and backend. You just need to select what you want to deploy and then you can easily deploy in one click.
