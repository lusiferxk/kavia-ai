### Step 2: Enter Your Prompt

In the input box, describe the app you want to create. For this tutorial, enter the following prompt and Click the **Arrow Icon** :

> **"Build a simple web-based calculator. The calculator should support basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should have a clean, responsive user interface with buttons for digits (0–9), operators (+, −, ×, ÷), a clear (C) button, and an equals (=) button. Display the current input and result in a screen area at the top."**

Kavia will process your request and begin building the application automatically, complete with frontend and backend code (if required), UI layout, and logic.

### Hint: Prompt Writing Tips for Best Results

To get the most accurate and complete applications from Kavia, follow these best practices when writing prompts:

*   **Be clear and specific**: Describe the core functionality, design preferences, and behavior of the app.
    
*   **Include user interactions**: Mention what the user should be able to do (e.g., “User should be able to submit a form and receive a confirmation.”).
    
*   **Mention design or UI requirements**: If you want a particular layout or style, include it in the prompt.
