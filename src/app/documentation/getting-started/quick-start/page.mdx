> _**Hint:** Prompt Writing Tips for Best Results_

To get the most accurate and complete applications from Kavia, follow these best practices when writing prompts:

<ul className="list-disc marker:text-orange-500">
<li>**Be clear and specific**: Describe the core functionality, design preferences, and behavior of the app.</li>
<li>**Include user interactions**: Mention what the user should be able to do (e.g., "User should be able to submit a form and receive a confirmation.").</li>
<li>**Mention design or UI requirements**: If you want a particular layout or style, include it in the prompt.</li>
<li>**State desired technologies (optional)**: If you prefer specific frameworks or stacks (e.g., React, Flask), add them to your prompt.</li>
<li>**Use complete sentences**: Natural language helps Kavia interpret your intentions better than keyword-only instructions.</li>
</ul>


### Step 3: Confirm Project Overview and Core features.
