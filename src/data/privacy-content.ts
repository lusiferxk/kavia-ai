<div style="font-family: Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kavia AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (<strong>"Kavia"</strong> or <strong>"we"</strong> or <strong>"us"</strong>), is committed to your privacy. As a subscriber and user (<strong>"you"</strong> and <strong>"your"</strong>) of the Kavia.ai "software as a service" artificial intelligence driven software development platform (the <strong>"Solution"</strong> and the <strong>"Services"</strong>), we want you to know what personal and other user information (the <strong>"Information"</strong>) that Kavia collects, uses, stores and discloses in connection with your use of the Solution and the Services. The information below sets forth Kavia's policy (the <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>), which applies to Kavia's use of your Information. This Privacy Policy is part of and, by this express reference, incorporated into Kavia's Terms of Use.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">1. Information You May Provide or Give/Submit to Kavia</h2>
  
  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">When subscribing to, creating an account and then using the Solution and Services, you may or will provide us with personally identifiable information, e.g., your name, billing address, email address, credit card and demographic information (by way of example and not limitation, personal interests, gender and/or your age).</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">2. The Information We Collect</h2>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">Computer Cookies/Log File Information/Web Beacons [Gifs]</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">As and when you use the Solution and the Services, one or more persistent and/or session "cookies" (which are small text files placed on your computer that can uniquely identify you/your browser). These are used to collect you Information including, but not limited to, your (i) computer operating system, (ii) information about your computer device(s), (iii) the type and version of web browser you use, the dates and time you access the Solution and the Services, and the web pages you visit or use when doing so.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">As part of our collection of Information, our servers collect information and may use what are called GIF files or "web beacons" (which is a tiny, transparent image file [usually just 1 pixel by 1 pixel] that is embedded in a webpage or email), and when you use your web browser on our Site, you may then send us Information that includes, by way of example, a "log file" (providing us with your Internet Protocol (<strong>"IP"</strong>) address, the type of browser and browser language you are using, domain names and the various web pages you visit or navigate to or from (including the "universal resource locator" related to that web page (<strong>"URL"</strong>)), as well as platform types, debugging information, error logs, statistics related to you use, dates and times of use. We also may use web beacons to track online usage patterns anonymously (i.e., information collected will not include information that identifies you personally), and to track when emails are opened.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">Analytical Information and Information from Third Parties</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">We may receive Information (including personally identifiable information) from third parties, regarding your use of various computer applications, purchase and other transactional information, or your interactions with service and product providers. We also use a variety of analytical tools to assist us in measuring usage (trends and traffic patterns), and these tools are used by us to improve our Services by collecting information your browser makes available when you navigate to a web page, such as the add-ons your browser may use, the dimensions it requests (e.g., display page height and width), and other information that helps us to improve our Solution and Services. When we use our analytical tools, we do so in a way that prevents us from being able to identify any specific individual user.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">Data Security</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">We use commercially reasonable commonly used practices in order to secure and safeguard your Information. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your Information, or that it may not be accessed, modified, used or destroyed by unauthorized parties that may overcome our security systems and protocols. If we become aware of a breach of our systems or access by unauthorized parties we will undertake to notify you using commercially reasonable means, including, without limitation, posting a notice on our website (so you can undertake additional protective steps that may be available).</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kavia may use your Information to contact you by email, but only if you have consented to us doing so and we allow you to opt-out if you have consented; provided that we are and will use your email information for administrative purposes such as billing and communicating user account related information. We also use your Information (both your personally identifiable information (<strong>"PII"</strong>) and certain non-personally identifiable information (<strong>"NPII"</strong>)) to improve the Solution and the Services (e.g., creating new features, improving functionality) and to assist you in when you use the Solution/Services (storing certain information so you do not have to re-enter it, track overall usage by users of the Solution/Services, analyze the effectiveness of our product marketing programs).</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">4. How and When We Disclose Your Information</h2>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">We use and provide PII and NPII to affiliated companies and certain service providers we use in order to operate the Solution/Services and to interact with you, such as processing payments related to your account, and when doing so, we require them to adhere to this Privacy Policy and to take reasonable steps to secure, maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and limit the use of the Information by such parties. We only share PII with other parties for their use in commercial or marketing programs if you have consented to our doing so, and we provide you with the ability on our website to opt-out at any time (in your account settings). NPII is used and shared with third parties we work with to better understand how we can enhance the effectiveness of our Services, the Solution, and any advertising/marketing programs we undertake.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">In addition, if we receive a request from law enforcement, and we are required to disclose PII and/or NPII by law, or we reasonably believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary in order for us to comply with state or federal law, or to respond to subpoena, search warrant or lawful court order, we will disclose the PII/NPII so requested. We may also disclose PII/NPII if we determine, in good faith, that doing so is required or appropriate in order to protect Kavia from legal liability, defend against 3<sup>rd</sup> party claims, secure and protect the Solution and/or the Services or enforce our Terms of Service/Use.</p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin: 30px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">5. Assignment/Transfer of Your Information</h2>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kavia reserves the right, in the event Kavia's assets (all or a portion thereof), or control and/or ownership of Kavia (via merger or other combinative transaction), is acquired by a third party (an <strong>"Acquiror"</strong>), your Information may be transferred and/or assigned to an Acquiror without requiring further approval by you. Similarly, in the event Kavia files for bankruptcy or otherwise is subject to any insolvency, receivership or similar creditor related legal or equitable resolution of claims process, your Information may be transferred and/or assigned to 3<sup>rd</sup> parties involved in such process (without our being able to control the future use of your Information).</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">We may also allow other parties, typically those operating advertising networks or involved in the delivery of advertising services and content, to send you, via your browser, advertisements and product marketing related content using your IP address when you are on or use the Kavia website. These companies may use certain information (but not your name, email or personal address, or telephone contact number) when serving advertising and marketing materials. We only provide PII if you have consented to our doing so and always provide the ability to opt-out at any time. This privacy policy does not, however, apply to these 3<sup>rd</sup> parties, which typically post their own privacy policies (which you should consult if interested in how they use your Information).</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">Your Options and Choices</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">You are and will be able to decline to submit PII to us but without your PII certain functionalities related to, and your overall use of, the Solution and Services may be impaired or negatively impacted. You are free to update and change your PII on your account page at any time.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">United States Based Solution & Services ~ Note to Users Outside the United States</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kavia's Solution and Services are hosted and provided from within the United States and are directed and intended to users located therein. If you are outside of the United States, those areas, countries and jurisdictions may have laws and regulations governing PII and NPII (and data collection and use generally) that are different than those applicable to users inside the United States, and by your using the Solution and the Services you are consenting to the transfer to and storage and use of that Information by use in the United States.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0; text-align: center;">Periodic Updates to Our Privacy Policy</p>

  <div style=" padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>We may revise and update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Kavia reserves the right to, without advance notice, periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy (as Kavia determines in its sole and absolute discretion), and after doing so will update the "effective as of" date information set forth above (when updated, the then revised Privacy Policy will apply and supersede the prior versions).</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 40px;">By and when using the Solution, you are agreeing that the Privacy Policy posted and published on Kavia's website is easily available, such that each time you use the Solution/Services, you are reaffirming your agreement to having reviewed and to your agreeing to the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>
